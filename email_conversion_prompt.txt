## Required Files to Create
1. email_template.html - The base HTML template with Medium-style formatting
2. aws_blog_YYYY-MM-DD.html - A fully populated HTML page with content from the email (with date in filename)
3. summary.md - A 200-word summary of the email content in Markdown format
4. hero_image.png - A featured hero image generated with AWS Nova Canvas

## Medium-Style Design Requirements

- Use "AWS" as the author initials in the profile image
- Include appropriate author metadata in both English and Chinese versions
- Maintain professional tone consistent with AWS Solutions Architect communications

## Hero Image Generation
- Use AWS Nova Canvas MCP to generate a hero image
- The image should visually represent the main theme of the AWS announcements

- Create an abstract or conceptual representation of cloud technology
- Ensure the image has good contrast for text overlay if needed
- Suggested prompt for Nova Canvas: "A conceptual illustration representing [main theme of announcements] in AWS cloud services, with abstract technology elements, using AWS brand colors, minimalist style, suitable for a blog header"

## Content Organization
Organize the email content into these categories:
- AI and Machine Learning
- Infrastructure
- Databases and Analytics
- Other Services

## Summary Format
The summary should be a concise 200-word overview that highlights:
- Key service announcements
- Regional expansions
- Important feature additions
- Balanced coverage across service categories
- Written in a more narrative, blog-like style

## Translation Requirements
- Translate all section headings, feature titles, and descriptions to Chinese
- Ensure proper language attributes (lang="en" and lang="zh") for all content
- Maintain consistent terminology for AWS services in Chinese
- Adapt writing style to be more conversational and blog-like in both languages

## HTML Structure
The HTML should include:
- Language switcher in the top-right corner
- Header with title in both languages
- Large hero image below the title
- Author information showing "AWS Gaming SA" with appropriate styling
- Estimated reading time
- Summary section with content in both languages
- Category sections with features in both languages
- Pull quotes or highlighted text for emphasis
- Footer with placeholder for metadata and sharing options
- CSS for language switching functionality and Medium-style typography
- JavaScript for toggling between languages

## File Naming Convention
- Use the format "aws_blog_YYYY-MM-DD.html" for the output HTML file
- Extract the date from the email or use the current date if not available
- This ensures each week's conversion is saved as a separate file

## Workflow Steps
1. Read and analyze the email content
2. Extract the date from the email to use in the output filename
3. Generate a hero image using AWS Nova Canvas MCP
4. Create the HTML template with Medium-style formatting and language switching functionality
5. Organize content by category
6. Write a 200-word summary in English with a more narrative style
7. Translate all content to Chinese
8. Populate the HTML template with bilingual content and the hero image, using "AWS Gaming SA" as the author
9. Save the final HTML with the date-based filename (aws_blog_YYYY-MM-DD.html)
10. Create the summary.md file

This workflow will transform AWS announcement emails into engaging, Medium-style bilingual blog posts with professional visuals and concise summaries, while preserving each week's content with unique filenames.
